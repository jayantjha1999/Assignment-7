Difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

-------ABSOLUTE---------

1)Syntax:
{
 position:absolute;
}

2) With absolute positioning, an element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position property other than static) or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found.

3) The position of the element is specified using the top, right, bottom, and left properties, which determine its distance from the edges of its containing block.

4) Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal document flow, meaning it does not affect the positioning of other elements on the page.

------Relative Positioning------

1)Syntax:
{
 postion:relative;
}

2) Relative positioning positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.

3) The element's position is shifted using the same top, right, bottom, and left properties, but instead of being relative to its containing block, it's relative to its normal position.

4) Unlike absolute positioning, the space taken up by a relatively positioned element is preserved in the document flow, so other elements on the page are affected by its position.
